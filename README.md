___

> A solo roleplaying game of loss, memory, and vampires.
>
> In Thousand Year Old Vampire you chronicle the many centuries of a vampireâ€™s existence, beginning with the loss of mortality and ending with inevitable destruction. Prompt-driven play and simple resource tracking provide easy rules for exploring your characterâ€™s human failings, villainous acts, and surprising victories.  Expect gut-churning decisions and irreconcilable acts.
> 
> The game mechanics are simple and intuitive. Play progresses semi-randomly through a book of Prompts which let you explore your vampireâ€™s wants and needs, resolve problems, and chart the decline into senescence. Play can happen entirely within the character sheet or can become a journaling activity--both work equally well.

## TYOV-APP Description
TYOV has 72 progression prompts with 3 entries each and 9 ending prompts. Players progress by rolling a d10 and d6, subtracting the d6 from the d10, and using that number to progress through the prompts. If a player reaches a prompt they have reached before, they progress to the next available entry, and if all 3 entries have been reached by the player, the move to the next available entry in the next prompt(s).

While playing TYOV for the first time, I found it a bit confusing to remember which entries I had visited before and found it difficult to keep the hardcover book open while also writing down my experiences and memories (it's a gorgeous book, but a bit physically stiff). It seems like a silly complaint, but I saw a perfect opportunity to make the game a bit more accessible and easier to play. And here we are!

This program starts you at Prompt 1, Entry 1. When you click "Next Prompt," it automatically roll your dice and takes you to the next prompt. It keeps track of which entries you have visited before so when you hit a prompt you have already visited before, it takes you to the next available entry. When you reach the end of the game, you no longer can roll dice. Exit out of the Prompts window when you are done.

## Cool Features

-â€‹Options for an alternate starting or ending prompt

-Options to include alternate prompts

-Options to change the likelihood of seeing said prompt

-Option to roll two d10s instead of one for multiplayer games or for quick games

## Known Issues
Clicking the "Click here for first prompt" button on the main TYOV-APP window once does nothing if you close the prompts window. All you have to do is click it again and a new prompt will pop up. This is normal.

The program is getting flagged as malware by antiviruses due to being compiled with PyInstaller into one file. I have tried using many other compilers (Nuitka, cx_Freeze, Briefcase, etc) but have come across issues with not being able to get the data files in the executable. I'm open to trying other compiliers, but I think I will have to settle with a false positive program.

## How to Run TYOV-APP
Download the files and extract.
Tell your antivirus that the program is actually safe and then run TYOV-APP.exe
